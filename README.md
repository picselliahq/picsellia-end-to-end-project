# Picsellia ü•ë end-to-end project
This repository showcases the implementation of an end-to-end Computer Vision project using Picsellia ü•ë with a use case on object detection. 

The following are the steps which are covered within this project: 
- üíæ Data management
- üìà Model training & monitoring 
- üöÄ Deployment to production
- üèπ Inference with the deployed model 
- üîÅ Continuous training and deployment


## Setup a virtual environment 

In order to isolate the dependencies used in this project, setting up a Python virtual environment to run this projects recommended. 

Run the following commands in your project folder: 

```shell
cd project_folder
python -m venv <venv_directory> 
```

Activate the virtual environment you created by executing this command (as an example, my venv is called myvenv): 

```shell
source myvenv/bin/activate 
```

## Setup the environment variables 

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of this project and add to it your **API_TOKEN** 
that you can retrieve it in your profile page on Picsellia and your **ORGANIZATION_ID** that you can retrieve from the url in the browser in this format: https://app.picsellia.com/ORGANIZATION_ID/dashboard

```
API_TOKEN="YOUR_API_TOKEN"
ORGANIZATION_ID="YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID"
```

## üíæ Data management 

In Computer Vision projects, data management is the most time consuming step. 

With Picsellia ü•ë, this is no longer the case! 

### 1. Upload your data to the Datalake 

By storing all your data in the Datalake, you can take advantage from the following features:
- Visualize all your data and have an overview on its metadata.
- Search easily by using tags and Picsellia's querying language.
- Filter and modify your data easily via the UI.
- Import your data from a third party data storage service.

You can upload your data to the Datalake in two ways: 
- Via Picsellia platform UI by navigating to the Datalake tab and following the steps after clicking the button **upload data**. 
- Via Picsellia's Python SDK by running the following command in your terminal: 
````
python upload_data.py
````

If you choose to upload your data via the sdk, take into account to update the `config.py` file. In the [config.py](config.py) file you can precise the path to your data (e.g train, test, val) in your local machine, and the tags you want to use to identify your uploaded data. 

### 2. Create a dataset with data from the Datalake

You will now create a dataset with the data that you need from your Datalake. 
Since you have added tags when uploading your data to the Datalake, now you can leverage the capabilities of retrieving data with the tags, to create respective dataset versions e.g **train** version, **test** version and **valid** version. 

To do that, you can follow either of the following ways: 
- Through Picsellia's platform UI using the **query language** to select data with the tags that you precise and then by clicking on create dataset as shown below:

![create dataset](/docs/create_dataset.png)

- Via Picsellia's Python SDK by doing the necessary configuration in the [config.py](config.py) file. The most important configurations to note are the **TAGS**, **DATASET_VERSION**, **DATASET_TYPE**, **LABELS**: 
````python
# Dataset 
DATASET_NAME = "your-dataset-name"
DATASET_DESCRIPTION = "you dataset description"
NB_OF_DATA = <number of data to retrieve> 
TAGS = ["tag1", "tag2"]

# Dataset version
DATASET_VERSION = "train"
DATASET_VERSION_DESCRIPTION = "training version"
DATASET_TYPE = InferenceType.OBJECT_DETECTION
LABELS = ["label1","label2"]
````
- Then, running the following command in your terminal as many times as you need to create your different dataset versions after changing the configuration in each time you run it:
````shell
python create_dataset.py
````

One thing to note about the **DATASET_TYPE** is that Picsellia supports the following types: `"CLASSIFICATION"`, `"LINE"`, `"MULTI"`, `"POINT"`, `"SEGMENTATION"`, `"OBJECT_DETECTION"` or `"NOT_CONFIGURED"`. So make sure to choose the appropriate type to the task you want to perform with your dataset. To do that, you can edit the [config.py](config.py) file. As an example as shown below the `InferenceType` is OBJECT_DETECTION: 

````python
DATASET_TYPE = InferenceType.OBJECT_DETECTION
````

After doing the described steps to create three dataset versions: **train**, **test** and **valid**, this is the result you should get by navigating to the **Datasets** tab on Picsellia:
